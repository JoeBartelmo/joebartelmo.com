A full 1950s bathroom remodel, took 4 months.

Estimated contractor install: ~20-30k

My install: ~7k

I'm not going to do a writeup right now for this. I learned a lot and made plenty of mistakes, if people are interested i'll write something, but here are the photos:

## Before and After Highlights

Below are some and after shots that I believe bring together how much a transformation it was. These all can be found on the drive link above.

## Entry

Had to widen the door by 6 inches, and increase entryway height by 5 inches. Ever frame a door by hand while trying to use the wood that's there already? Yeah I hate myself too.

## Sink

Hand made floating vanity with a bowl sink. I hope you think its beautiful, I think some of my tears are woven into the wood.

## Tub and Shower

Vertically tiled 2-tone shower. Made a mistake and put a drop-in tub in instead of an alcove, we get some water buildup sometimes,
but it's not a really big deal, we wipe it down after showering. The tub is deep soaking, and extra long so you can sit down all the
back of the tub acts like a little recliner of sorts.

### Close up

If you look really closely at the shower niche, you can see the pain and suffering
that went into tiling upside down.

## Some notes

* The bathroom is almost completely sound proofed. This was done because it exists in between two bedrooms, and i'm a light sleeper. When I have kids I want to be able to sleep if they want to take a shower at 10pm.
* The bathroom has a heated floor
* This project added 10sqft to the bathroom, we cut out a poorly designed closet
* Live edge wood vanity took 3 weeks to finish by hand
* You can thank my wife if you like the design of this bathroom - she also tiled 80% of the floor.
* You can send me a "F" to pay some respects for accomplishing her designs, 1 brick at a time.
