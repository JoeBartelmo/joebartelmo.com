I'm in the final stages of finishing my basement, but I don't want to forget some of the more terrible things I had to do to finish it - before they slip my mind. I will be making several posts over the coming end of year to detail all the work that went into finishing the basement. The final post will include before/after and designing. 

To timeline this, the very first work that was done - before even designing is included in this post - which happened in October/November of 2022. There were things that HAD to get done before I could even begin work on finishing the basement, and they are included here.

## Before - The basement when we bought the house.

It's a pretty standard basement. Block walls, there is an interior channel drain (surface level, not below like a french drain) that goes into the corners of the room. There is a slope from one end of the basement to where the drains are. The slope is a little dramatic, where the ceiling height is 7 foot 1 at the smaller end and 7 foot 5 at the other, there is a noticible drop closer to the drains. I basically ignored the slope and opted to make things relative to the slope in the room, which made finishing harder, but saved my ceiling height.



### TODO Lists

#### Prep work

These are all things we gotta do before we even think about framing.

| Item | Description |
|-|-| 
| Knock hole in concrete | There is a block wall seperating my basement from a 30 foot connected garage with a single door. 
| Remove Boiler | An old boiler system that is no longer in service |
| Remove Boiler Pad | A concrete pad where the boiler was |
| Remove Boiler Pipes | There were boiler pipes running through the whole basement, varying size |
| Remove Junction Boxes | Plenty of juntion boxes in the basement from the previous owner, can't leave them if i drywall the ceiling |
| Fix Water Leak | There's a nasty leak from where the oil pipe entered the house, caused by a cracked conduit on the outside |
| Update In-law Suite wiring | Old aluminum and out of date wiring extending to my in law suite - needs to be updated to 6/3 at least (it's like alumnium 8/2)|
| Fix Water penetration in Utility Room | There is a concrete front porch with as small room underneath that contains water issues, hydrostatic most likely |
| Single pane metal windows | Need to be updated to double pane, one of my first tasks |
| Replumb septic system | Not all of it, just the stuff above ground, the cast iron pipes are still in decent shape. |




#### Finishing Work

Will be detailed in next post


## Basement Designing

![Floorplan](/assets/images/basement-pt1/floor-plan.png){:class="img-responsive"}

This is the rough floorplan we were going for - the design happened and was finished around December of 2022. The only parts that existed on startup of this project was the bathroom. The garage at the time of starting was extra long - 30 feet. The plan is to section off 10 feet of this and turn it into a small office. I began with this and the windows before winter hit - they were old fashioned steel framed windows with single pane glass. I replaced them with double plane.

## Difficulty List

Usually I get asked about what the hardest part was, here is a table of what i thought was difficult and what wasnt

| Item | Difficulty | Reason |
|--|--|--|
| Siding | Easy | Level it all out in the beginning, lots of cuts but not bad. Don't fall off the ladder |
| Flooring | Easy | Do it at the right time and you'll have no problems, before trim after walls after paint |
| Trim | Medium | This room was annoying because of the amount of trim i had to do, each piece of wood around the window was custom planed and made by me |
| Hearth | Hard | Lots of measuring, lots of leveling, lots of time, while applying concrete easy to mess up |
| Chimney | Hard | Even more measuring than hearth cause you're now in 3 dimensions, also had to triple check everything to prevent fires |
| Insulation | Easy | Takes forever, but easy and itchy, just had to remember baffles. |
| Electrical | Easy | Always my favorite |
| Wood Stove | Medium | Heavy as heck, had to be clever to avoid hurting my brand new sunroom |
| Drywall | Hard | I ended up hanging all the drywall myself, hired someone to finish it, it was too time consuming and I found out its cheap |

For the wood stove, to get it over the stoop coming in i actually built like a makeshift ramp out of two-by fours. By some miracle nothing got injured. The thing weighs over 400lbs

### Injury

There are photos in the drive about when I cut off the tip of my finger. Was just me being an idiot. I saw online people cutting these vinyl planks with their utility knives and thought "hey that looks easy" It wasn't, it slipped while i was cutting with a lot of force.
