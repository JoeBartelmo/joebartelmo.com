I may do a mini-series of posts on this at some point, this was a long lived project, and will always have little touch-ups worth of work. If I do I'll update the table below with links to the pages.

This project was one I've wanted done for a long time, effectively doubling the square footage of this house, now up to 2800ish from 1500 when we bought the house. This was a very long and complicated project with a great many ups and downs, but all in all took about 1 full year to finish end to end with everything in between.

This project required me to prepare everything for the future while working on it - I wanted to drywall the ceiling and have minimal access panels, this all therefore took a lot of work to get the basement into "finishing shape".

## Basement Design

![Basement Floorplan](/assets/images/basement/after/floorplan.drawio.png){:class="img-responsive"}

The worst part of the design was positioning of everything we wanted. Comprimises had to be made several times due to the size of the basement. The unfinished basement had only the bathroom (already finished), and the closet at the bottom of the plan.

The original garage was 30ft in size, so we will be capturing some of it back with a small office.

We wanted to keep the laundry shoot, so the laundry room had to stay put where it was.

The TV is hung directly in front of the window is the only flaw in the design. The TV could not be mounted facing the garage wall because of the support beam's awkward placement in the imddle of the basement - right in front of where the seating would go. I had an option to seal the window, but I thought the extra light would be nice when not in use. I think this was probably a mistake tbh, but only time will tell.
